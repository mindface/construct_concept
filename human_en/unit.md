## unit
Language units in information processing for existing social design
When defining subjects and basing them on socially formable foundations, tool-enable linguistic expression
Information volume in meta-information
- Scope of formation at unconscious and ego levels
- Awareness of cognitive information and design structure modification scope
- Definition information evaluation definition cycle structure optimization
- Adjustment for feedback cycle evaluation

Information volume in experience units
- Purpose and incentive structure (goalOfIncentive)
- Evaluation formation (EvaluationFormation)
- Optimization (Optimization)
- Process construction from target (TargetProcessStructure)
- Functional evaluation of target (targetFunctionalEvaluation)
- Definition of information (Definition)
- Strictification of Information
- Structuring Processes for Goals Using Stored Information (goalAndProcessStructure)
- Unconscious Process Output and Candidate Selection (UnconsciousProcessOutputCandidateSelection)
- Subdivision Candidates Selection
- Continuity of Information
- Feedback Cycle (feedbackCycle)
- Cooperative Formation
- Forming Rules of Thumb for Timescales and Frequencies of Execution Processes
- Friction in Implementing Theory and the Scope of Feasibility
- Hierarchical Structuring
- Inheritance of Information
- Shortened Definition Information
- Tooling of Definition Information
- Information Abstraction Tooling
- Organize Information
- Conceptualization of Target Thinking Through Shape (Diagram)
- Working Memory Area Memory Connections
- Scope of Definition and Adjustment for Functional Definitions and Language Symbols
- Scope of Attention and Use of Black Boxes


Formation Level of Modifiable Scope through Involvement in Unconscious Process Selection, Evaluation Criteria, and Operations
Adjustment of Task Content
Social Design Enabling Habitually Impossible Tasks

Example)
Layer Structure of Feedback for Information Definition and Tooling
- Structure of meta-cognitive evaluation formation
- Link information
- Optimal output of attentional thinking cases
- Heuristic optimal output
(Research on optimal intuitive solutions across time lags)
- Formation of process construction toward objectives
- Process construction and formation for information subdivision

Example)
Habitual definition => (Definition)
Change in cognitive information => goalOfIncentive
Plan trigger
Definition => info => makerMemoryImageDefinition
Continuity (makerMemoryImageDefinition)
=> Design of plan information adjusted through unconscious formation and plan linkage
